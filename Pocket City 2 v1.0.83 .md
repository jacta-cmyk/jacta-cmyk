From choosing building locations to managing resources and providing urban services, everything is in your hands. The game features a simple yet powerful user interface that allows you to easily develop different areas, design streets, and make important economic and social decisions.

One of the standout features of this game is the ability to explore the city in third-person view, a rarity in similar games. This feature makes Pocket City 2 several steps ahead of its predecessor.
